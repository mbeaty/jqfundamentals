Rebecca Murphey has a great free book, called jQuery Fundamentals, which is hosted online at

http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html

The book and related course material is also hosted on github (link on page above). However
there is no page that I could find that actually hosted the web pages for the exercises. So
I have created a github repository to host these pages. They can be accessed on my github
user pages at
